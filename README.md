# Meliodas

Meliodas is a fully functioning Docker based PHP development environment, specifically designed for Laravel development.

Not only does it provide a fully functioning development environment, it also provides a production environment that is as close to your development environment as possible.

You can use it to develop your Laravel application on your local machine, and then deploy it to a production server with ease.

Meliodas can also be easily extended to support other PHP frameworks.
